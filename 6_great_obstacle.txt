On their way to the magical cave there was a large flood. They stop and Chuck said - What the heck, this is not supposed to be here!
Morgan Freeman - It must be the Brad Pitt who cast a spell to stop us!
Chuck - Oh that handsome, rich bastard! but dont you worry my friend! My gourgeus legs cant help us with this one!
But suddenly a load and deep voice said - Good im with you then guys!
Its was Dumbledore, Chuck's pet and sidekick fly with an enormus ego speaking from Chuck's side pocket.
Dumbledore - I can help you, he said. And flew out of pocket. Chuck jump up on my back.
A second later they were in the air. Chuck on Dumbledore's back and the ugly giraffe morgan hanging in the tail from Dumbledore's mouth.
