On their way to the magical cave there was a large flood. They stopped and Chuck Norris said - What the heck, this is not supposed to be here!

Morgan Freeman - It must be Brad Pitt who cast a spell to stop us!

Chuck - Oh that handsome, rich bastard! My gourgeus legs cant help us with this one!

But suddenly a load and deep voice said - Good im with you then guys!

Its was Dumbledore, Chuck's pet and sidekick fly with an enormus ego speaking from Chuck's side pocket.

Dumbledore - I can help you, he said and flew out of pocket. - Chuck jump up on my back!.
A second later they were in the air. Chuck on Dumbledore's back and the ugly giraffe morgan hanging in the tail from Dumbledore's mouth.
